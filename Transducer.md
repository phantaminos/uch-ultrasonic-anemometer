# Introduction #

The transducers we are currently using are "Waterproof Ultrasonic Sensor II" from Futurlec (part number: USTR40-14A). http://www.futurlec.com/USTR40-14A.shtml.

This transducers can transform electrical signals into sound waves and vice versa. The transducers are design to have maximum efficiency at 40 kHz. Waterproof sensors have are constructed in a single piece casing with prevents water and humidity to get in contact with the piezo electric material. A drawback for this is that conversion from sound to electrical signals is weaker, resulting in signals as low as 10 mV and a high amplification is required.
